# Cadence

A toy project for building lightweight game or game like experiences in Multiplatform Jetpack Compose.

## ECS

The core of this project is a simple Entity Component System, ECS, that coordinates and drives the elements you build into the `GameWorld`. For more reading on ECS and using them, check out:
